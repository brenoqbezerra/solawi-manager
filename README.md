## Spreadsheet Structure

The system uses a Google Sheets spreadsheet as a database, with the following structure:

### Active Sheets in MVP:

   - Do not alter column structure

### Reserved Sheets (not implemented in MVP):

- **Satze**: Reserved for future implementations of technical crop details

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
- Do not modify the column structure in the sheets
- Do not rename or delete existing sheets
- Keep column names unchanged
- Make regular backups of your data

## Installation
